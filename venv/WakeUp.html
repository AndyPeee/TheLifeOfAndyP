I will be putting all my comments in this file, as it is both the first page when you "Wake up" in the game,
and it is the first page I started working on, as well as the fact that there are two buttons on this page.

Also, for some reason the only way to open this file properly is to right click on the file, then click show in explorer,
then click the file again.
